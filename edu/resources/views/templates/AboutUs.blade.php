                        Founded in 2021, Application UNI has grown into a leading educational platform dedicated to
                        providing
                        transformative learning experiences and shaping global citizens. Over the past decade, we have
                        successfully enriched the lives of more than 3,800 students through meticulously planned
                        educational
                        tours, collaborating with 180+ Indian schools to deliver immersive and inspiring journeys that
                        combine
                        education with exploration.

                        Our commitment extends beyond tours—we have proudly supported over 1,000 Indian students in
                        realizing
                        their academic dreams by securing admissions to some of the world’s most prestigious
                        universities.
                        Leveraging strategic partnerships with over 450 international schools and universities, we
                        provide
                        tailored solutions for both educational tours and overseas education, ensuring every student’s
                        unique
                        aspirations are met.

                        Recognizing the growing demand for quality educational services, we recently expanded our
                        footprint to
                        Dubai, securing approval from KHDA to serve students and schools in the UAE and MENA regions.
                        This
                        milestone underscores our dedication to broadening access to world-class educational
                        opportunities,
                        fostering global exposure, and nurturing the leaders of tomorrow.

                        At Application UNI, our mission is to bridge the gap between potential and achievement, offering
                        a

                        students to reach new heights in their educational journeys.

                        <h4>Our Story</h4>
                        <p>
                            ApplicationUni was founded with a vision to make the dream of studying abroad a reality for
                            students
                            around the world. Our journey began with the belief that every student deserves access to
                            world-class
                            educational opportunities. Over the years, we have built a network of experienced mentors,
                            educational
                            institutions, and support staff dedicated to guiding students on their educational journeys.

                            From our humble beginnings, we have grown into a global organization that facilitates
                            educational tours,
                            application guidance, and one-on-one mentorship for students aspiring to study in top
                            universities
                            across the world.
